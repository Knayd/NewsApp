Theresa May was left fighting to save her Chequers Brexit plan and with it her authority as prime minister after she was ambushed at the end of the Salzburg summit when EU leaders unexpectedly declared that her proposals would not work. A referendum on the Brexit deal would take at least six months to organise legally, making it very difficult to have a second vote before the UK is scheduled to exit the EU on 29 March next year, constitutional experts have said. Leading Brexiters have criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for his extraordinary break in diplomatic convention in which he branded prominent leavers as liars who had misled the British people. For all the pre-event talk about Brexit and internal rules, Labour’s annual conference will have an official focus on boosting living standards and helping communities, themes central to the party’s election campaign last year. The Ministry of Defence is at serious risk of failing to run a working nuclear deterrent, parliament’s spending watchdog has concluded. On Thursdays local council byelections take place.

The governor of the Bank of England has warned the cabinet that the impact of a no-deal Brexit could be as catastrophic as the financial crisis that crippled the UK economy a decade ago. Eurostar trains may stop running in the event of a chaotic no-deal Brexit, the French minister for Europan affairs has warned.

The Oklahoma school principal only signed up with the party a few years back so that his vote might mean something in a state where the Republican party overwhelms politics. At the time, he was keen to vote against a state school superintendent he regarded as a disaster. Johns stuck with the Republicans even as they used their grip on Oklahoma’s legislature to bind the state ever tighter in the ideological straitjacket of tax and spending cuts at the cost of public services, not least education. He remained with the party as the number of teachers at his school plummeted, class sizes surged, and diminished pay forced his staff to find second jobs. Even as students were reduced to studying from battered text books older than themselves and some Oklahoma schools opened just four days a week. Now, after three decades in the classroom, Johns has had enough – and he is not alone. The principal of Ada junior high school, in a small city in the south-east of the state, is among a surge of teachers who stepped out of the classroom and into politics on the back of a wave of school strikes across some of the most Republican states. Johns won his first ever primary with a campaign focused on funding for schools and is expected to win election to the Oklahoma legislature in November in what he sees as a backlash against years of his own party’s ideology. “People have seen what all the tax cuts can do to not only education but all of our state agencies whether it’s mental health, roads and bridges, prisons,” said Johns. “I think Oklahoma is moving away from the hardline conservative Republican to something more moderate. They see that the promises that were made have not delivered.” The teachers strikes began in a corner of West Virginia in February to demand a pay increase and a better health care plan, and swiftly spread across the state with a two-week walkout. The protests fired up educators in other states often struggling with pay so low they held two jobs but also angered by falling school budgets. Teachers in Oklahoma followed with a nine-day strike. Educators in Arizona walked out for a week and those in Colorado for two. The teachers won some of what they wanted. In West Virginia, educators got a 5% pay increase but not improved healthcare. Arizona’s teachers secured a significant pay rise and increased school funding. But the wider impact of the protests has been on politics, not least within the Republican party. The strikes radicalised some teachers, demonstrating not only their influence but the public support they command, and prompted a surge in educators running for office. Hundreds are on ballots competing for state and local offices, and teachers have already claimed important political scalps. A math teacher in Kentucky ousted the Republican majority leader in the state legislature, and rising star of the party, from his seat in the GOP primary in May. The strike also exposed growing public weariness in some of the most conservative states with years of tax and public spending cuts that have failed to deliver the promised prosperity. Nowhere has the existing political order been rocked more than in Oklahoma where even the threat of a strike by teachers turned Republican policy on its head. Public education is a major employer in many smaller, less prosperous communities and the GOP leadership in the legislature recognised whose side voters were on. The politicians swiftly broke with years of cuts to impose the first tax rise since 1990. They increased duty on cigarettes, gas drilling and internet purchases to fund a $6,100 pay rise for public school teachers. But educators walked out for nine days anyway to demand $200m to fund schools. That set up a confrontation between legislators, who thought the teachers were not sufficiently grateful for the political leap they took in raising taxes, and educators who thought the politicians didn’t get that the strike was about more than pay. Years of school budget cuts have resulted in Oklahoma spending 25% less on educating each student than a decade ago, resulting in ever-bigger class sizes and fewer resources as well as teachers leaving for better pay in neighboring states. The state governor, Mary Fallin, likened the striking teachers to “a teenage kid that wants a better car”. One Republican state representative, Jeff Coody, riled teachers by denouncing their strike as “akin to extortion”. Joan Gabelmann, an assistant principal in Lawton public schools, was so incensed she ran for the Democratic party nomination for Coody’s district and won it against another educator. Gabelmann said that Coody’s reaction was typical of the reception teachers received when they marched on the state Capitol in support of increased school funding. “Ninety percent of the politicians were extremely disrespectful and did not want to hear our voices,” she said. “It angered a lot of people and it caused a lot of disillusionment. The misconception was the teachers got their raise so what’s your problem? It’s not about a raise. It’s about funding education for our kids.” Carri Hicks, a math and science teacher who earned $29,000 a year working full time and is running for a state senate seat in Oklahoma City, was angered by a meeting with a Republican senator on the education committee. “He told me I was lying when I shared with him my class sizes. I made the decision that if they weren’t going to listen to teachers and understand the complicated issues that we’re tackling in the classroom right now, then we’ve got to get somebody to serve who actually understands what it feels like to be in those overcrowded, underfunded classrooms to make any kind of movement on this issue,” she said. State representative Mike Ritze’s vote against the pay increase prompted a challenge from four teachers. Janice Graham, who spent 35 years as a school psychologist and educator, was so offended by Ritze’s attitude that she ventured into politics for the first time and won the Democratic nomination to run for his seat in November. “What happened in the walkout showed to me how little we are represented. They did not listen. Mike Ritze was very rude to educators. Shame on us for letting him go unopposed all these years. None of us had our eyes on it. The teacher walkout just turned the lights on. It was, ‘Look at these people’. If they’re not representing teachers, who else aren’t they representing?” said Graham. “I’m 58. I’m a smart woman. I’m a strong woman. I thought, I’m going to put my hat in.” Johns – who also joined the strike because he is weary of seeing teachers at his school leave for better-paid jobs in neighboring Texas or Arkansas, and of class sizes that jumped from about 15 students to 25 – said he was disturbed by the response of some Republican politicians to the teachers. “It really surprised me when I saw how some of the legislators were reacting to some of the teachers. It wasn’t how they should have been received,” he said. The strike, or the response of many Republican legislators to it, prompted Oklahoma’s teachers to line up in record numbers to run for office and they had the public behind them. Tens of thousands of people turned out to back the educators at the Capitol. Teachers were fair game for Republican politicians for years. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, thought it good politics to respond to teacher complaints about underfunded schools by shouting at them to do their jobs, and to tell a teachers union it deserved “a punch in the face”. But that was no longer true in Oklahoma. Of the 19 Republicans in the state legislature who voted against the tax increases to fund teacher pay raises, eight lost their primary races weeks later. Education figured large in their downfall even if it was not the only factor. Seven others decided not to run for reelection leaving only four of the original 19 on the ballot in November. Coody and Ritz were among those who were voted out. Hicks’ Republican opponent, state Senator Ervin Yen, also fell in the primary. “Teachers have got smart about their politics and say, ‘You’ve been lying to us. Yes, you supported the teacher raise but you didn’t vote for the revenue to pay for schools so we’re not going to take your empty promises any longer. We’re voting you out’. I think it’s awoken this sleeping giant. I just hope that the fire in our bellies carries through to the polls,” said Hicks. When the teachers walked out in Oklahoma, they found ready support from those voters weary of the Republicans’ failed economic experiment. Years of tax and service cuts in the state intensified after the Tea Party wave in 2010 and the election of Fallin as governor. Voters were sold a promise that lower taxes would prompt a boom in business and prosperity. Not only did it fail to materialise but a collapse in the price of oil, which accounts for a good part of the state’s revenues, plunged Oklahoma into a billion dollar budget deficit. That did not stop Fallin continuing to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes for high earners and businesses even as Oklahoma highway patrol officers were ordered to limit the number of miles they drove in order to save fuel, rural clinics were driven out of business by Medicaid cuts, and public infrastructure crumbled. \uFEFF“Everybody thinks that Oklahoma is a traditionally red state but there’s a lot of people being awakened,” said Jacobi Crowley, a 26 year-old African American educator and church minister, who is expected to become the youngest state senator in the country for a district around Lawton in the southwestern Oklahoma. “People have been asleep on issues and things that have been affecting the state of Oklahoma like education, criminal justice reform, economic diversity – all those big topics. It’s not that they have not been interested in it. They have been focused on their family, focused on their job. Now that people are able to sit down and really hear what’s going on and see the numbers, you’re seeing a lot more people saying, ‘How did we get here? How can we fix this?’ “There’s an understanding that if you’re not involved then there are consequences.” Crowley earns $32,000 a year teaching and holds down a second job selling advertising to make ends meet. Gabelmann said the teachers strike finally focused public attention on what many parents have known for years as the bills for basic classroom supplies, sometimes running into the hundreds of dollars, arrived at the beginning of each school term. “Schools have been strip mined of our money. That trickle down economics, we’re a poster child for what can happen when that’s allowed to occur through voter apathy,” she said. “It’s a good thing we have an election in November. My heart just sings. It’s sad on one side but on the other we have voters that are more aware of the situation, and because of the teachers situation they’re now also more aware with what’s going on in health care and services. We don’t need these grey haired old men making decisions about our lives. I do think people are paying attention more so than they have before in our state.” Asked if he is in favor of reversing years of Republican policy and imposing tax increases, Johns hesitates for just a moment and then says he is. Tax cuts, he said, have proved a false investment. “I know what we need. I know what our students need. Education affects everything. You want to get incarceration rates down, educate. You want to get drug abuse down, educate. You want to get more people off of welfare, educate. Teen pregnancies? Education. A more employable workforce, education,” he said. Increasing taxes is no longer the taboo it once was even in some more conservative circles. In January, a coalition of business and civic leaders, Step Up Oklahoma, called for higher taxes on fuel, tobacco and gambling to deal with the budget deficit and fund public services. One sign of the dramatic turnaround in attitudes was oil company executives backing an increase in tax on production. But any attempt to move the state toward higher taxing and spending has to overcome a Republican-engineered ballot measure from the 1990s which requires a 75% vote in favor by the legislature to increase taxes. Moving broader but just as ideological policy may prove easier. Both Johns and Democratic teachers on the ballot want to see a shift away from the de facto privatization of education and the relegation of public schools to a second-class service for the poor and marginalized. Hicks, who has a child with a disability, feels it personally because she said her son would almost certainly be rejected by private schools even if she could afford one. “I have seen a lot of really gross things up close that give me pause and make me wonder if there’s an intentional attack on public education right now in that they’re trying to defund it to a point where parents don’t see it as a viable option for their students and therefore seek out for-profit charters or for-profit private entities to educate their children. “It’s not right,” said Hicks. “We see that especially in the south side of Oklahoma City. It’s a large immigrant population and overcrowding on the south side is probably the worst in the state. To me it seems very intentional. We’re not being equitable with our funding and so I just know that having a teacher voice inside our state government will ensure that we at least can stop some of the things that I think have them put into motion over the last 10 years.”\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar/news\",\"pillarName\":\"News\"}]}}";

In prisons, just as in our communities, the impact of sport can be far-reaching. Participation can not only improve health and behaviour but can directly contribute to efforts to tackle reoffending, reduce violence and conflict, develop communication skills, and in particular provide a meaningful route into education and employment. Last year I was asked by the Ministry of Justice to conduct an independent review into the use of sport and physical activity in youth and adult prisons. I visited and audited the provision of prisons, young offender institutions and secure children’s homes throughout England and Wales, speaking with individuals from across the staffing structure and the children, young adults and adults in their care. I invited responses to a public consultation and met with community groups and dozens of people whose lives have been changed through sport in prison. These experiences helped to shape the recommendations I set out in my review. Although the findings demonstrate that much still needs to be done, the review highlights positive sporting achievements that have already taken place in our prisons – supported by organisations such as Parkrun UK, the Duke of Edinburgh scheme and Fight for Peace – which have provided the motivation and skills for people to turn their lives around. These achievements are all the more remarkable given the levels of despair and brutality often encountered within our prison system. But provision remains patchy and underdeveloped. My recommendations called for our prisons to be supported with an integrated physical activity and wellbeing strategy, because physical activity can only be fully promoted and implemented if it is underpinned by a whole-prison commitment to improving mental and physical wellbeing. This in turn needs to be the result of effective partnerships, not just between staff in the prison gym and their colleagues in prison healthcare and education, for example, but between our prisons and the amazing network of community sporting groups and bodies we are fortunate to have throughout the UK. An integrated strategy will help us respond to the diverse needs of those held within our prisons. We incarcerate an increasingly ageing population: there are now more over-60s in our prisons than under-21s. And provision for women and girls is particularly underdeveloped, so my review calls for a national strategy on physical activity for the female population, in order to guide practice and target resource. Women and girls in custody do not engage in physical activity to the same extent as men and boys, and as a result they are not benefiting from the social, physical and psychological benefits it offers. There is a strong case for the role of physical activity in meeting the unique needs of women in custody, but this needs to be supported with approaches that reflect an understanding of gendered barriers to participation and exercise, which often mirror those outside of prison. Sport and physical activity have enormous potential to motivate individuals to desist from crime, particularly by increasing employability and encouraging reluctant learners to engage in education when they would otherwise be unwilling or feel unable to participate due to negative experiences (as evidenced in a previous paper). Given the widespread interest displayed by men and women in custody in pursuing sports and physical activity-based qualifications, I urge prisons to support training in these areas. Such qualifications provide ex-offenders with a direct route into employment if supported with relevant work experience and external placements. In its response to my review, the MoJ promised: “We will be investing up to £1.8m per annum to enhance opportunities across educational and physical activity offered by providers and establishments. This could include new education and sports-based projects, community partnerships, and upskilling staff to facilitate a broader education curriculum.” But promises from the MoJ of supporting an already stretched prison service will only go so far. We will need more collaboration with our physical activity sector and other community partners, who must now get behind the recommendations and activate the plan. This week I’ll be joining leaders from the worlds of sport, physical activity and justice at the ukactive National Summit to build those partnerships. Two major players in the physical activity sector have committed already, with Virgin Active and Places Leisure set to establish pilots early next year. They will work with ukactive, the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, the MoJ and Her Majesty’s Prison &amp; Probation Service to provide training and opportunities for vetted, former category d offenders to work in various roles, from receptionists to caterers, lifeguards to personal trainers. These pilots will seek to make greater use of prison estate facilities and will guarantee interviews upon the completion of training. It’s just a start but this type of joined-up approach could inject new hope into our system and really change lives. • Rosie Meek is a professor of psychology and founding head of the law school at Royal Holloway University of London\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar/opinion\",\"pillarName\":\"Opinion\"},{\"id\":\"sport/2018/apr/04/commonwealth-games-2018-sport-by-sport-guide\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"sport\",\"sectionName\":\"Sport\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2018-04-04T18:46:36Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Commonwealth Games: sport-by-sport guide on the Gold Coast | Martha Kelner\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/04/commonwealth-games-2018-sport-by-sport-guide\",\"apiUrl\":\"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/04/commonwealth-games-2018-sport-by-sport-guide\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Commonwealth Games: sport-by-sport guide on the Gold Coast\",\"shortUrl\":\"https://gu.com/p/8cgkj\",\"thumbnail\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8bafecaca0a25c41e30f111678938494897198a/71_205_4824_2895/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"Cycling Home nations Both the track and road teams are low on established names but rich in young talent. English riders took six gold medals at the 2014 Games, including victory in the women’s road race through Lizzie Armitstead but the Yorkshirewoman has not travelled, nor has new mum Laura Kenny. England’s men’s track team is headed by Olympic champion Philip Hindes, while Team Scotland are led by Katie Archibald, whose brother John has also been selected. International Australian cyclists have been keeping their powder dry to race on home soil, looking to exceed the seven golds, out of a possible 13, they won on the track in Glasgow. Athletics Home nations Katarina Johnson-Thompson arrives fresh from becoming world indoor pentathlon champion and is favourite to win heptathlon gold, with Olympic champion Nafi Thiam of Belgium ineligible. Johnson-Thompson’s boyfriend Andrew Pozzi was also crowned world indoor champion in the 60m hurdles and is among the favourites to win over the 110m hurdles. Dina Asher‑Smith, Adam Gemili and Zharnel Hughes take on the might of Jamaica’s sprinters and all look in good early season form. International Sally Pearson is likely to get the biggest cheer of the week at the athletics venue, just 10 minutes drive from her house but is struggling to overcome an achilles injury. South Africa’s Caster Semenya is making her Games debut but is expected to do the 800m and 1500m double in Australia. She missed 2010 because of legal wranglings over her eligibility to compete. Swimming Home nations Adam Peaty is arguably England’s strongest gold medal hope in any sport, the biggest unknown being how quick he will go in the 100m breaststroke and whether he will attempt to break his world record. International England versus Australia in the pool is being billed as an Ashes rematch. The home team have the advantage of being familiar with the outdoor conditions of the Optic Aquatics Centre. Cate Campbell, who suffered a meltdown at the Rio Olympics and is seeking to put things right, is leading the female challenge. South Africa’s Chad Le Clos won six medals at the Games four years ago and will seek to defend his 100m and 200m butterfly titles. Boxing Home nations Twins Pat and Luke McCormack are part of the 12-strong England team and both have strong medal claims. England won five of 13 medals on offer in Glasgow and super heavyweight Frazer Clarke claims the team were inspired by the recent title fight victory of his occasional hitting partner Anthony Joshua. International Australia’s Taylah Robertson secured the first medal of the Games before they even began. She is guaranteed at least a bronze in the women’s 51-kg division after receiving a bye to the semis. Only seven boxers are competing in the category and both losing semi-finalists receive bronzes. But she is expected to fight for gold. Squash Home nations Despite years of campaigning, squash is yet to convince it is deserving of a spot in the Olympics, meaning these Games remain a key competition. England’s Nick Matthews is bidding for a third straight Commonwealth title but may have to overcome his compatriot and another former world No 1, James Willstrop. England’s Laura Massaro is also top seed. International Eight-times world champion and two-times Commonwealth champion Nicol David of Malaysia will be aiming to upset Massaro. Gymnastics Home nations Max Whitlock will be disappointed if he does not manage to retain his beam, pommel and floor titles. England’s women have been blighted by injury withdrawals with Claudia Fragapane, Ellie Downie and Amy Tinkler all absent, meaning 15-year-old Taeja James, Team England’s youngest member, received a late call. International There is very little strength in depth in Commonwealth gymnastics beyond the home nations. Only one male, non-British athlete from a Commonwealth nation – Canada’s Zachary Clay – made a final at last year’s world championships in Montreal, where he finished 21st in the all-around competition. The women fare slightly better with Canada’s Ellie Black having won a world medal. Diving Home nations Olympic champions Chris Mears and Jack Laugher will consider anything less than gold a disappointment as will poster boy Tom Daley. Team Scotland’s Grace Reid made her Commonwealth debut as a 13-year-old in Delhi in 2010 but at 21 is being jokingly called Grandma Grace. International Australian diver Taneka Kovchenko was forced to retire days before the start of the Games for health reasons with a decision yet to be made on who will partner Melissa Wu in the 10m synchronised event. Netball Home nations Team England arrive after some of the best results in their history and will be aiming to upset the Antipodean stranglehold. International Australia versus New Zealand is one of the most fierce rivalries in world sport with their matches at the Gold Coast Convention Centre sold out. Weightlifting Home nations Zoe Smith was forced to work in a cafe to fund training after a devastating shoulder injury and is on the comeback trail aiming to add to her three Commonwealth medals in the 58kg division. International Much of the focus will be on New Zealand’s transgender Laurel Hubbard (formerly Gavin), whose presence in the 90kg-plus division has been controversial. Table tennis Home nations Anna Hursey is an 11-year-old prodigy competing for Wales, while veteran Paul Drinkhall leads the English challenge. International Singapore is the powerhouse of Commonwealth table tennis, having won 44 medals at the last four Games. Basketball Home nations Both England’s men’s and women’s teams have chances of winning medals. International First included in the 2006 Melbourne Games, this time round Australia and New Zealand are likely to battle for gold with the home nation favourites. Beach volleyball Home nations England train in a chilly Dorset shed but 6ft 9in Chris Gregory and his partner Jake Sheaf are No 3 seeds for the inaugural Commonwealth tournament. International Beach volleyball is a new addition in favour of judo which was dropped after the Glasgow Games. It will be held on Coolangatta beach. Australia’s women’s duo Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar hope a home crowd can spur them to victory. Rugby sevens Home nations England’s squad includes seven members of Team GB, who picked up silver medals at the Rio Olympics. International Fiji’s win over Britain in the men’s sevens final at Rio 2016 means the Pacific Islanders come into the Games as favourites, but will face stiff competition from South Africa, England and New Zealand among others. Shooting Home nations Northern Ireland’s David Calvert competes in a record-extending 11th Games, seeking a fifth gold.

With more than a quarter of the nation’s adults “inactive”, according to the Active Lives survey released in March, Sport England wants to ensure students are leaving secondary education with an active lifestyle. Jennie Price, the chief executive of Sport England, said: “While some youngsters have a great experience of PE and sport at school, others don’t, and our research shows that can put them off being active for life. Lots of people have bad memories of being picked last for a team or just feeling really uncomfortable in PE lessons. This programme is designed to stop that happening.” The scheme will run through the national network of teaching school alliances, training teachers in new activities from zumba to volleyball and encouraging school leaders to value PE. Last year the government doubled the funding for PE in primary schools to £320m a year, and 1 million primary school children are now taking part in the Daily Mile running programme, but secondary schools have been without any financial investment or national schemes in the subject for the last decade. A third of pupils leaving primary school are overweight or obese, making it more difficult for secondary school PE teachers to ensure their lessons are inclusive. Meanwhile, schools are under greater pressure than ever to perform in academic subjects, and a Youth Sport Trust survey found that 38% of teachers said PE time had been cut for 14- to 16-year-olds in the past five years. The former Olympic sprinter Darren Campbell, whose company works in schools, said there was a link between sport and mental health. “Competitive sport is being taken away and it’s becoming all about taking part,” he said. “Life is competitive, just getting a job is competitive. Sport is life lessons, learning how to win and learning how to deal with defeat. We’re failing to prepare young people for disappointment.” Another Olympian, Denise Lewis, welcomed the focus on how teachers delivered PE lessons but expressed concern about what she saw while visiting schools. “The lack of coordination in young people is alarming. I’ve been to schools where children aged nine and 10 just can’t skip,” she said. “It’s great they’re addressing secondary school PE but I still believe that by the time children are in year 6, if they are fitter and more coordinated, they will be more readily keen to participate in exercise at secondary school.” Lewis also highlighted an issue facing teenage girls. “Most girls I see don’t have the correct fitting bras. They’re conscious of their shape while they’re participating in exercise, so they don’t commit fully. They’re participating with the handbrake on because they’re so self-conscious about their body.” She said teachers needed to consider innovative and sensitive ways to support parents in providing appropriate kit. Ross Myhill, the head of PE at Thomas Gainsborough school in Suffolk, one of 40 taking part in a pilot scheme, described the impact it was having, from training teachers to deliver activities such as yoga and handball to making the most of existing facilities through additional after-school clubs. The school is running inclusive competitions for lower-ability students, such as a “Highland Games-style” sports day with welly throwing and tug of war. “These are students who have never represented the school [in sport] in their whole lives. They get to experience that same sense of pride, and competition,” Myhill said. “I’ve been teaching for 15 years and I don’t think there’s been such a hands-on scheme before. You have up to £20k to upskill staff to give secondary school students more opportunities and get them active. “We’ve got a rock climbing wall in school but – and it’s horrible to say it – we don’t have enough money in the school to be able to put people on a rock climbing course to deliver the lessons.” With the new funding, Myhill hopes to be able to offer lunchtime and after-school sessions, as well as opening up the facility to the local community.\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar/news\",\"pillarName\":\"News\"}]}}";

Because crossword setters are kindly folk, the other half is a little recipe of the letters in the same word, and that recipe often has some abbreviations in it. What abbreviations? Happily, these are things you’ve seen going about your non-crosswording business. The word “cold” might remind of you of a C from a tap; “Spain” should make you think of an E on the back of a car. What else? Well, royal-wedding cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason quite rightly worries that today’s children are missing out on a music education; crossword setters, equally rightly, presume that music is part of life and that solvers will know a handful of its abbreviations. Abbreviations such as ... P. Even if you’ve missed out on sheet music, as a solver, you associate the word “piano” with P. This is “piano” as in “play this bit quietly”, rather than the instrument – but setters concoct their clues so that they seem at first to be about the instrument. So when Shed writes ... 25ac Promise to put piano on shelf (6) ... this is not a piece of staggeringly ill-advised storage advice. Instead we replace “piano” with P and “shelf” with another word for “shelf” (LEDGE) and get a word for “promise”: PLEDGE. The same goes for “quietly”; here’s Vulcan … 1d Insect lived quietly (4) … where you replace “lived” with WAS and “quietly” with P for an insect: a WASP. What about “loudly”? Good question; now you’re thinking like a champion solver. Here’s Rufus: 12ac An opinion to contradict loudly (6) Here “contradict” gives us BELIE and “loudly” an F (forte, if you insist on getting technical), so the opinion is a BELIEF. Less often, in music and in puzzles, you might see “very quietly” (PP), or “very loudly” (FF). Now let’s look at a controversial device, or at least one that Guardian solvers have said they find frustrating. “Note” in a clue often indicates a single letter in an answer; since that letter could be A, B, C, D, E, F or G, that keeps the suspense going a little too long for some. Still, it’s out there in the puzzles, so you need it in your armoury – and you also need to know that, as in this clue from Brummie … 12ac Political supporter’s note secured in advance (6) … there are another seven possibilities! Here you’re taking COME (“advance”) and inserting (here’s our guide) the note MI to end up with COMMIE, because “note” can also be MI, as well as DO, RE, FA, SOL and TI. Oh, and “note” can also be the abbreviation N, from outside the world of music. What I’m saying is: be deeply wary of “note”. Two more before you return to your grids. Lists of a composer’s achievements call each work an “opus”, abbreviated to OP, and so “work”, as in this clue from Tramp … 9ac Storyteller withdrawing main work (5) … is OP, the “main” is the SEA (backwards because of “withdrawing”) – and the storyteller is AESOP. Finally, “bass” has a clear enough meaning when you know you’re talking about music, and its abbreviation is easy enough to guess, but the clue might use “bass” in a way that makes you think of an ale, or in this clue from Puck, something in the sea: 9d Bass has warning about fish in opera (6,7) Here, in fact, the fish is a HERRING, which you mix with ALERT (“warning”) and B (yes, that’s “bass”) for Benjamin Britten’s ALBERT HERRING.

And seasoned solvers, any favourite musical clues, or other things to look out for?\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar/lifestyle\",\"pillarName\":\"Lifestyle\"},{\"id\":\"music/2018/sep/26/bestival-music-festivals-business-bought-for-11m\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"music\",\"sectionName\":\"Music\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2018-09-26T18:58:43Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Bestival music events firm bought for £1.1m\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/26/bestival-music-festivals-business-bought-for-11m\",\"apiUrl\":\"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/sep/26/bestival-music-festivals-business-bought-for-11m\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Bestival music events firm bought for £1.1m\",\"shortUrl\":\"https://gu.com/p/9ft5n\",\"thumbnail\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc67b1bad1716f6815a1168e2867cc8e9bb64564/0_99_3976_2386/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"The Bestival and Camp Bestival music festivals have been snapped up by a multi-millionaire Dorset entrepreneur just days after a collapse into administration. Richmond Group, controlled by the loan broker James Benamor, is buying the festival business after offering £1.1m for Bestival’s assets and brand. Richmond had lent Bestival Group £1.6m in February last year. Benamor founded Amigo Loans, a Bournemouth-based company that offers quick guarantor-backed loans, which was floated on the stock exchange in July. The business is valued at more than £1bn and Benamor’s Richmond Group has a stake of 61%. Julie Palmer, of the advisory firm Begbies Traynor, who was appointed administrator on 20 September, said she had received more than one offer for the business but Richmond’s was the best bid. Bestival was launched in 2004 by DJ Rob Da Bank and this year was headlined by the performers Chaka Khan, Grace Jones and Thundercat. It began on the Isle of Wight but relocated to Lulworth Castle in Dorset in 2017. Its sister festival, Camp Bestival, which launched in Dorset in 2006, is aimed at a family audience and this year featured Simple Minds and Rick Astley alongside Peppa Pig and Paddington. In a statement Benamor said: “We have been fans and supporters of Bestival since the beginning. Our children have grown up with wonderful memories of these festivals. Bestival is an example of Dorset being world class and we are keen to ensure that this fantastic institution goes on to delight families and local businesses for many years to come.” On the Camp Bestival website it said that tickets for the 2019 festival remained valid and there was “no reason to believe Camp Bestival won’t go ahead as planned”. Hundreds of 2018 Camp Bestival attendees are still hoping for a refund after the festival was forced to close a day early in July because of poor weather. The company said the cancellation of the festival’s Sunday line-up this year was not the reason for its financial difficulties but said it had not been “a positive factor for the business”. Richmond Group said that under the terms of its offer all Camp Bestival 2019 tickets sold so far would be honoured.\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar/arts\",\"pillarName\":\"Arts\"},{\"id\":\"film/2018/sep/20/20-best-music-documentaries-ranked-rock-pop\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"film\",\"sectionName\":\"Film\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2018-09-20T15:15:23Z\",\"webTitle\":\"The 20 best music documentaries – ranked!\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/20-best-music-documentaries-ranked-rock-pop\",\"apiUrl\":\"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/sep/20/20-best-music-documentaries-ranked-rock-pop\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"The 20 best music documentaries – ranked!\",\"shortUrl\":\"https://gu.com/p/9e4x4\",\"thumbnail\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/263f3142b802adf6d850d4610416939fd72dcf78/0_113_2500_1500/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"20. Big Fun in the Big Town (1986) Charming Belgian TV presenter Marcel Vanthilt tries to get to grips with the New York rap scene. Interviewees include LL Cool J and Schoolly D, but this featurette is as alert to social nuances as musical ones. 19. Starshaped (1993) This catches Blur on the brink of the Britpop explosion, looking keen but confused, and often the worse for wear. Car-crash highlights include Damon Albarn falling off a speaker and John Peel expressing amusing indifference to their music. 18. Oil City Confidential (2009) Canvey Island pub-rock combo Dr Feelgood get the movie treatment from The Great Rock’n’Roll Swindle director Julien Temple. 17. Amy (2015) Asif Kapadia’s Oscar-winning film about Amy Winehouse expertly stitches together everything from home movies brimming with hope to end-of-the-line concert appearances when the jig was truly up. 16. 20 Feet from Stardom (2013) The unsung voices behind the stars finally get their due in this story of backup singers including Darlene Love and Judith Hill. 15. Buena Vista Social Club (1999) Wim Wenders has always been drawn to misfits, from Patricia Highsmith’s Ripley in The American Friend to Harry Dean Stanton as the eternal wanderer in Paris, Texas. He brought his taste for the outsider experience to this film about the Cuban ensemble making its first trip to America. 14. I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco (2002) Turmoil is a gift to the music documentary. Wilco were up to their eyes in it soon after the photographer Sam Jones started filming them: they shed two of their members and got dropped by their label. Out of the chaos, a great album (Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) and a revealing film emerged. 13. The Road to God Knows Where (1990) The recent Nick Cave documentaries One More Time with Feeling and 20,000 Days on Earth showcase a mature and reflective artist. For unsparing grit and grime, there’s Uli M Schueppel’s black-and-white film of the Bad Seeds’ 1989 US tour, heavy on the boredom and frustrations of life on the road. 12. Dave Chappelle’s Block Party (2006) Michel Gondry documents the on-and-off-stage sights of a 2004 Bed-Stuy bash thrown by Chappelle, who bussed in members of the public from his home town of Dayton, Ohio. Performers include Kanye West and Lauryn Hill; the political commentary is low-frequency but consistent, with Fred Hampton Jr, son of a murdered Black Panther and chairman of the Prisoners of Conscience Committee, telling the crowd: “Hands up, eyes open, fists clenched.” 11. The Devil and Daniel Johnston (2005) The wild creativity of the folk musician Daniel Johnston turns out to be inseparable from his woes as he struggles with bipolar disorder. He sings! He preaches! He attacks his manager with a lead pipe! Through it all, the director Jeff Feuerzeig maintains a sympathetic eye. 10. Rude Boy (1980) Part-documentary, part-staged reality (a technique that the film’s co-director, Jack Hazan, had pioneered in his David Hockney doc A Bigger Splash), this inserts a fictional roadie into the real world of The Clash on tour. A scorching and often ugly portrait of a band at a full pelt and a country in decline. 9. Gimme Shelter (1970) There is no shortage of Rolling Stones documentaries, from Godard’s One Plus One aka Sympathy For the Devil and Robert Frank’s little-seen Cocksucker Blues to Martin Scorsese’s more recent Shine a Light. But the cream of the crop, the absolute Exile on Main Street of the bunch, is the Maysles brothers’ account of the band before, during and after the horror of Altamont. 8. Lawrence of Belgravia (2011) Lyrical filmmaker Paul Kelly finds Lawrence, lead singer of indie gods Felt, glam pasticheurs Denim and Casio-pop pioneers Go-Kart Mozart, somewhat on his uppers. He faces eviction from his council flat as he records a new album. Yet in his refusal to sell out, Lawrence is an enduring symbol of artistic purity. Explaining his resilience, he says: “No one else has got this far, and failed.” 7. Anvil! The Story of Anvil (2008) Alongside Some Kind of Monster and DiG!, this is another slice of cringingly frank mid-noughties verité, the key difference being that the group in question, a Canadian metal outfit, came within sniffing distance of fame without ever quite making it big. A reunion tour provides a near-as-dammit real-life equivalent to Spinal Tap. 6. The Decline of Western Civilization Part I (1981) Penelope Spheeris directed the first film about the American response to punk, with interviews and performances from Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag and Germs, the menace of the latter tempered by dumpy frontman Darby Crash, known to cover himself with peanut butter and dive through broken glass to disguise the fact that his band couldn’t play. Quality control stayed high for Spheeris’s follow-ups, Parts II (about metal) and III (homeless punks). 5. DOA: A Rite of Passage (1980) This film diary of the Sex Pistols’ fateful 1978 US tour zig-zags between the Stateside vaudeville and interviews from back home with establishment figures closing their ears to the yelps of punk (“I’m not going to listen to what they say until they learn to enunciate clearly and speak properly in the Queen’s English”). A grimly compelling highlight is the footage of Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen lolling in bed like the anti-John-and-Yoko. 4. DiG! (2004) Two bands for the price of one: The Dandy Warhols take the fast train to fame and adulation while their brothers-in-psychedelia, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, languish in semi-obscurity, their integrity intact, their sanity perhaps less so. Ondi Timoner boiled down a staggering 1,500 hours of footage to create this study of luck and self-sabotage in rock’n’roll. 3. Metallica: Some Kind of Monster (2004) Metal behemoths Metallica quietly fall apart in this long but spellbinding documentary which finds them plagued by indecision and uncertainty as they grapple with their incomparable success. With one band member gone and another entering rehab, the band members submit to a “performance enhancement coach” who insinuates himself creepily into the creative process. 2. Bob Dylan: Don’t Look Back (1967) DA Pennebaker’s fingerprints are all over music cinema (Monterey Pop, Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars). But his masterpiece follows a restless, searching Bob Dylan as he tours Britain in 1965, confronting journalists, holding court among some peers (Joan Baez, Alan Price), sneering at others (sorry, Donovan) and, with the Subterranean Homesick Blues cue-cards sequence, helping to invent the pop promo. 1. In Bed with Madonna (aka Madonna: Truth or Dare) (1991) Part of the alchemy of a great music documentary is catching the subject at exactly the right moment, and Alek Keshishian couldn’t have trained his cameras on Madonna at a better time. In the midst of the inventive and influential Blonde Ambition tour, he finds a self-possessed genius who is a magnet for controversy, as well as for other stars: Warren Beatty announces that Madonna “doesn’t want to live off-camera”, Antonio Banderas resists her advances, Kevin Costner gets roundly insulted. But this thrilling film, split between black-and-white for off-stage and colour for on, gives the lion’s share of screen time to the squabbling, excitable dancers who comprise the singer’s extended family. • This story was amended on 21 September 2018 to correct a reference to Darby Crash, who sang with Germs not Black Flag.\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar/arts\",\"pillarName\":\"Arts\"}]}}";

I’ve got to admit it gave me a warm glow when I “won” while playing an interactive artwork by Katriona Beales that mimics online gambling. The pleasure persisted even when her “game” informed me it had been compiling data based on my eye movements. Yet, as sickly diverting as it is, I can’t imagine waiting on a street corner, $26 in my hand, to buy the next hit of online cat portraits from my man. Hooked: When Want Becomes Need, the thought-provoking show that opens London’s new Science Gallery, mixes artworks about drug and alcohol addiction with pieces that explore the online world. It suggests that smartphones and social media may be as addictive – and harmful – as heroin or vodka. Yet the exhibition also illuminates a striking difference. While artists once turned to traditional narcotics for romantic inspiration, the compulsion to check that phone one more time is hardly going to give anyone visions of caverns measureless to man, as Coleridge put it. Only one work in Hooked summons up such pale wasted poets. Joachim Koester’s installation The Hashish Club uses green Moroccan lanterns and a projected photograph of a lush, orientalist sitting room to recreate Club des Hashischins, where intellectuals met in 1840s Paris. Its members included not only the poet Baudelaire and the painter Delacroix but also Alexandre Dumas, author of The Three Musketeers. (I’ve always wondered what D’Artagnan was smoking.) Over the romantic image of the room where these dreamers met, Koester layers a sinister morass of animated weeds – the silhouettes of very 21st-century street skunk. Addiction ain’t what it used to be. Like other affluent middle-class professionals, many artists today spend their money on cocaine. This was the drug of choice for the YBA generation, and it appears here in Richard Billingham’s 1998 video Jason Chopping. Tellingly, it is shown near to Billingham’s 1999 piece Playstation. Both are closeups of nervous, busy hands. If we’re all addicts, as Hooked asserts, what lies behind our shared sickness? Sitting in a car wash watching the roller engulf his windscreen, a recovering alcoholic in Melanie Manchot’s video installation Twelve explains that the animal part of our brains, beneath the neocortex where our higher human functions reside, is the one susceptible to addiction. This is the most explicitly scientific statement in the show. The Science Gallery works directly with researchers to develop exhibitions that bring art and science together. Its London branch (like the drugs trade, it is an international venture) is part of King’s College London. Yet Hooked wears its science lightly and refuses to be judgmental. You may be addicted to sugar, social media likes, or Fortnite, but no one here is criticising. But as the exhibition progresses, the consequences of addiction look ever more menacing and wasteful. Dryden Goodwin has worked with young offenders alongside Kim Wolff, director of forensics at King’s. All of the young men in the group were convicted of offences related to drug dealing. One is in prison for murder. To protect their anonymity, their faces cannot be photographed, so instead Goodwin has incorporated his expressionistic drawings of them into a moving and troubling film. Why is there so much addiction and who really benefits? Rachel Maclean’s mind-boggling video installation Feed Me suggests we’re being manipulated by blue-faced corporate trolls whose kitsch patter persuades us there is always something else we need. The endless dissatisfaction of consumerism is, according to her mesmerising, surrealistic vision, the most oppressive addiction of all. Maybe, but I’m not convinced that phones and shopping are the same as substances that alter one’s consciousness and may, for all the risks, appear to expand it. Poets, artists and musicians have dangerous relationships with traditional drugs because they find some release or inspiration in them. An alcoholic filmed by Manchot describes the freedom and power he feels when he drinks. It encapsulates the kind of dangerous intoxication that has fascinated – and ruined – so many creative people. This isn’t to say we are not addicted to phones. The terrible thought this exhibition invites is that, if the internet has made addicts of the entire human species, we haven’t got a recovery centre to go to. The new opium of the people is a club with no exit door. And you don’t even see visions. • At the Science Gallery, London, from 21 September. • This article was amended on 20 September 2018.

If you go home with somebody and they don’t have books, don’t sleep with them.” It’s a funny sentiment, but one he may feel has finally been achieved, as books – and their covers – have become something of an accessory. The rules of book cover design change decade by decade. Covers from the 1990s now look colourful and almost too busy (the wardrobe of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air would be a close aesthetic comparison). Tim Kreider, writing for The New Yorker in 2013, identified a lull in book design in the early 2010s that was exemplified, as he saw it, by a crop of white covers with simple lines of text (think Malcolm Gladwell or Haruki Murakami). For a time, it seemed that eBooks and kindles would displace their physical counterparts, but this didn’t quite come to pass. Like the recent revival of zines, the encroach of digital has resulted in a renewed appreciation for the physical – and beautiful. Part of this has been in direct response to eBooks; a tactic to boost the sales of physical books is to remake them as desirable objects, and a way to make objects desirable is, of course, to make them aesthetically appealing. But social media – specifically Instagram, which promotes the coveting of beautiful covers on hashtags such as #bookstagram – is putting a new emphasis on cover aesthetics. We no longer need to go home with someone in order to see their bookcase. “With social media, people display their books in more places than their personal libraries at home. They’ve almost become an accessory in some cases,” says Rachel Willey, a designer behind covers including Patricia Lockwood’s Priestdaddy (the title takes the form of a nameplate necklace against a freckled chest) and Melissa Broder’s merman-romance The Pisces (a woman passionately embracing a fish). “If I don’t like the cover, I won’t photograph it and put it on my feed,” says Femke Brull, a “bookstagramer” who runs @booksfemme. While she won’t avoid promoting a loved, if less-attractive book, she opts for a snap of the title page instead – even if it is less memorable than a beautifully covered counterpart. And she will “pay extra” for what she considers a better-looking edition. “I plead guilty to buying multiple copies of a book because I’ve seen an edition floating around that is prettier than my own,” Emily Klump (of @litinquiry) says. I’d do this too; I was disappointed when my own copy of Patricia Lockwood’s Priestdaddy arrived, with a cover that wasn’t Willey’s design. Faber and Faber’s recent releases signify a new focus on design; the publisher is giving away free letterpress prints of the cover of Sally Rooney’s new book Normal People (an ink illustration of a couple encased inside a tin of sardines) to those who pre-order. For Rachel Cusk’s Faye trilogy, designer Rodrigo Corral used work by the photographer Charlie Engman, whose pictures are often featured in magazines such as Vogue – and accordingly, the Cusk covers are stylish in a way that brings to mind coffee table or art books. Corral says social media directly affects his designs: “Our jacket art often has social media in mind, as we often create animated gifs, profile icons, and moving images that expand on the book jacket art and are designed to spread across the internet.” Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick, originally published in the US in 1997, was published in the UK for the first time in 2015, to a new wave of popularity. This was in no small part due to the zeitgeist catching up with Kraus; still, it’s not a leap to say its success could also be credited to a new, memorable cover: I LOVE DICK, emblazoned in big, bold capitals. In her review for the London Review of Books, Jenny Turner likened it to a pop single, in which the “song and band and title and cover all worked together to make what, if you were lucky, would be seen as an instant classic.” Wolfgang Tillmans’ “astro crusto” covers Olivia Laing’s latest book, Crudo: a clean, almost synthetically shiny, cracked crab of a delicate pink, with a fly hinting at decay. Laing has described Crudo as the first book for which she knew exactly what the cover should be (Tillman’s photograph brought to a mind a scene in which protagonist Kathy opens a crab with a hammer). It’s rare for a cover to have such a symbiotic relationship with its book, but that’s not to say that the two should be totally detached. A cover can’t change the contents of its book, but it can be a reader’s first impression of the book’s identity, especially with social media; as Willey says: “People now see covers before they get released, before even going to a bookstore.” The evolution of this relationship between platform, design and literature is seen in the New York Public Library’s new “Insta novels” project, which will see the library release animated condensed versions of novels such as Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland as Instagram stories. Even the fashion world has caught on to the idea of the book as accessory: for their 2018 autumn/winter campaign (which featured models reading), Loewe created a box set of literary classics, include Dracula and Don Quixote, with covers by photographer Steven Meisel. If this all makes you despair – that books’ insides are being usurped by their outsides – Loewe’s campaign is also a reminder of the gravitas that books bring. They aren’t just well-designed accessories, they’re items that imply intellect. “Imply” being the key word; no matter what Waters said, no one is going to sleep with you unless you get past the cover.\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar/arts\",\"pillarName\":\"Arts\"},{\"id\":\"politics/2018/aug/23/the-social-context-of-drug-abuse\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"politics\",\"sectionName\":\"Politics\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2018-08-23T16:42:17Z\",\"webTitle\":\"The social context of drug abuse | Letters\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/23/the-social-context-of-drug-abuse\",\"apiUrl\":\"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/aug/23/the-social-context-of-drug-abuse\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"The social context of drug abuse\",\"shortUrl\":\"https://gu.com/p/989at\",\"thumbnail\":\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6291ed5fbedeb9419808dbb616f6b529dc0dbb4f/0_102_2960_1776/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"Frances Perraudin’s article on cocaine deaths (Call for urgent investigation as cocaine deaths soar again, August 20) is timely. Cocaine is a potent stimulant but relatively expensive compared to other illicit drugs. Early use, say at a teenage party, primes later, adult use – this drug “memory” is a risk factor for addiction. Having followed the use and problems of cocaine in Britain for a quarter of a century, I can see why in 2018, marketing cocaine is so successful. Very large numbers of British people have tried it in their youth. Now primed to its stimulant action, and faced with the hopelessness of UK austerity, their grown-up use starts – but the lift to mood and energy is only brief. So they begin using cocaine hits more frequently, perhaps chain-smoking rocks of crack. That drug-seeking, chain-smoking behaviour is accelerated by the stimulant properties of their drug. Unstable mental states, dangerous high-dose use and increasing dependence on more crack take over. To reduce drug deaths, the government needs to understand the context in which its citizens use cocaine, and how bleak environments lead to lethal use. Woody Caan Editor, Journal of Public Mental Health • Using aid money to enforce the so called “war on drugs” is nothing but bad news for development (UK aid minister hails ‘double win’ of heroin crackdown in Tanzania, 20 August). Prohibition and the enforcement of illicit drug policies is one of the most overlooked development issues. It destroys the livelihoods of poor farmers, restricts access to medicines in Africa, criminalises the vulnerable, and fuels violence and inequality globally. From Ghana’s moves towards decriminalisation of possession to Uruguay’s legal regulation of cannabis and Bolivia’s legal coca programme, countries across the world are rejecting the damage caused by prohibition and pursuing clear alternatives. Evidence – including from programmes funded by UK aid – shows that harm reduction significantly improves the health and welfare of people who use drugs, particularly when accompanied by decriminalisation. It’s time for UK development policy to recognise the development impacts of prohibition. Instead of paying for it, UK aid money should fund evidence based harm reduction, sponsor research with affected communities, and support countries who want to end this failed war.
